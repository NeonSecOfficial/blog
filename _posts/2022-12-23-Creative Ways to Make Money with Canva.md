>Are you a creative person with an eye for design, but don't have the budget to invest in expensive software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator? Don't worry â€“ you can still make money using your design skills with the help of Canva, a free and user-friendly graphic design platform.

One way to make money using Canva is by creating and selling printables. Printables are digital products that can be printed out by the customer, such as planner inserts, art prints, or invitations. With Canva, you can easily create professional-looking printables by using the platform's pre-made templates and design elements. Once you've created your printables, you can sell them on marketplaces like Etsy, Creative Market, or your own website.

Another way to make money with Canva is by offering design services to small businesses or individuals. Many people don't have the time or skills to create their own marketing materials, such as social media graphics or business cards. By offering your design services on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr, you can earn money by helping others create the materials they need. You can also reach out to local businesses directly to offer your design services.

Finally, you can make money with Canva by creating and selling templates. Templates are pre-designed documents or graphics that can be easily customized by the user. For example, you could create Instagram post templates, resume templates, or business card templates and sell them on marketplaces like Etsy or Creative Market.

In summary, there are many ways to make money using Canva with no investment. Whether you create and sell printables, offer design services, or create and sell templates, you can use your design skills and Canva's user-friendly platform to earn money online.
